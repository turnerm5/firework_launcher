Make fireworks emit light, or have some sort of OpenGL blending.

Add new fireworks
	-Willow
		-Big explosion, long lifespan, trails. Might have to use a separate layer?
	-Multi-explosion
		-Big shells shoot out, they explode into separate charges
	-Bees
		-Bees come out, short delay, they zip away at random directions.
	-Fighters (advanced)
		-Two big stars come out, and then are attracted to each other, zipping by. Maybe firing at each other?
	-Warp
		-Big explosion, then the stars get sucked back into the origin
